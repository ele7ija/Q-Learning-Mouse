## Running the project in cloud
To run the project in cloud (powered by [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org)<sup>2</sup>) click [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ele7ija/Q-Learning-Mouse/master). After you click, wait a few moments for your server to start.

<sup>1</sup>: *td_exercise_gui.ipynb* is short for *temporal_difference_exercise_graphical_user_interface.ipynb* as: 
1) it is the model-free reinforcement learning method used in this project to approximate the state-action values (Q-function)
2) it provides the user interface for choosing the initial settings of the algorithm used in this project.

<sup>2</sup>: [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) enables you to run **jupyter notebooks** in cloud (resources provided by Google Cloud Platform). mybinder.org is composed of: *JupyterHub*, which manages cloud infrastructure for user instances, *repo2docker*, which builds Docker images from GitHub repositories and *BinderHub* which orchestrates the above two projects and provides the Binder interface. All of these components are hosted by an open project - [Project Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/governance).
